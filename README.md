## About the Project
<p>This project aims to create a simple, minimalist, and professional personal portfolio website where I can highlight my experience, skills, and projects as a front-end developer. The page is fully responsive and can be easily viewed on both mobile devices and desktops. It serves as a platform for personal branding and as an example of my abilities using modern web development technologies.</p>

## Technologies Used
<p>This project leverages the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML5: For the structure and semantic content of the webpage.</li>
    <li>Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the page efficiently</li>
</ul>

## Features
<ul id="features">
    <li>Responsive Design: The page adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) for a seamless experience.</li>
    <li>Modern Styling: Clean and modern interface styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.</li>
    <li>Project Showcase: A section where I display my key projects with descriptions and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.</li>
    <li>Skills Overview: A section where I present the technologies I work with and my current areas of expertise.</li>
<ul>

## Future Plans
<ul>
    <li>Vue.js Integration: I plan to refactor parts of the page into Vue.js components, such as the project cards and form handling, to improve maintainability and scalability.</li>
    <li>Backend Integration: Adding a backend with a database for handling contact form submissions, or integrating with third-party services like Formspree.</li>
    <li>Dark Mode: Implementing a dark/light mode toggle using Tailwindâ€™s dark mode feature.
Contributing</li>
    <li>JavaScript (Vanilla): To add interactivity and dynamic content to the page.</li>
