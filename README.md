About the Project
This project aims to create a simple, minimalist, and professional personal portfolio website where I can highlight my experience, skills, and projects as a front-end developer. The page is fully responsive and can be easily viewed on both mobile devices and desktops. It serves as a platform for personal branding and as an example of my abilities using modern web development technologies.

Technologies Used
This project leverages the following technologies:

HTML5: For the structure and semantic content of the webpage.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the page efficiently.
JavaScript (Vanilla): To add interactivity and dynamic content to the page.
Vue.js (Planned): To build reusable components and enhance the user experience.
Features
Responsive Design: The page adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) for a seamless experience.
Modern Styling: Clean and modern interface styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
Interactive Elements: JavaScript is used to make the page interactive, with animations and other dynamic features.
Project Showcase: A section where I display my key projects with descriptions and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
Skills Overview: A section where I present the technologies I work with and my current areas of expertise.
Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio-website.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copiar código
cd portfolio-website
Open the index.html file in your browser:

You can open the index.html file directly in your browser to view the site. Alternatively, you can serve it using a local server if you want a more dynamic development environment.

Install Tailwind CSS (optional for development):

If you're planning to make changes or customize the styling, you can install Tailwind using npm:

bash
Copiar código
npm install
Compile Tailwind CSS (optional):

To recompile the Tailwind CSS files after making changes:

bash
Copiar código
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
Future Plans
Vue.js Integration: I plan to refactor parts of the page into Vue.js components, such as the project cards and form handling, to improve maintainability and scalability.
Backend Integration: Adding a backend with a database for handling contact form submissions, or integrating with third-party services like Formspree.
Dark Mode: Implementing a dark/light mode toggle using Tailwind’s dark mode feature.
