## About the Project
<p id="about">This project aims to create a simple, minimalist, and professional personal portfolio website where I can highlight my experience, skills, and projects as a front-end developer. The page is fully responsive and can be easily viewed on both mobile devices and desktops. It serves as a platform for personal branding and as an example of my abilities using modern web development technologies.</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML5: For the structure and semantic content of the webpage.</li>
